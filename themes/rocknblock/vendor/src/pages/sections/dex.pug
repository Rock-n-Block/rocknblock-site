          | ?
        p.text DEX is based on a decentralized system - meaning that the server side of these exchanges exists on a blockchain. <br /> Using smart contracts that allow users full control over their assets before a transaction takes place. Thus, DEX is a more secure way to trade because we can avoid some of the restrictions of centralization, such as sanctions. Decentralization is provided by the DAO - a frequent DEX accomplice. All critical decisions are made independently by the community.
