          | Usually vested tokens belong to team members, advisors, partners, others who contributed to the development of the project, but also investors who purchased tokens before they went on general sale. It is very common for tokens to be released gradually over the vesting period, sometimes | once a month, once a week, or even daily as the project progresses.

          .cardDescription primarily concerned with limiting the speed or quickness with which project founders, teams and large investors can liquidate (sell) tokens. In this token vesting option, projects can shorten the vesting period to two years but increase the selling schedule to up to 4 years.

          .cardTitle Normal Vesting
          .cardDescription the tokens are locked up in a smart contract for a predetermined period. A project's founder(s) can decide to lock up a particular percentage of the tokens and release them periodically, say 20% after 6 months, 50% after 1 year, and the other 50% in the 2nd year.

      h2.title Why do businesses need vesting
      .descriptions Following increased exit scams and rug pulls in the crypto space, crypto players have developed several ways of protecting crypto investors from such scams. One such means of protecting investors is using liquidity lockers integrating several features, including token vesting. Token vesting refers to locking up investors’ tokens for a specific period to maintain a stable long-term value of a particular digital asset. Token vesting essentially prevents token holders from selling their tokens at once following the listing of a crypto project's coin or token, causing the market price to tank quickly.

      .descriptions Vesting is a term used to describe the fact that an asset is fully under the ownership of an investor. Crypto projects often use long-term token release vesting schedules for token sale investors. This effectively locks an investor into their given tokens for a lengthy period of time.

        | Token vesting is necessary to prevent such occurrences and boost
        | confidence in the potential participants of a token sale. The process
        | involves locking up certain amounts/percentage of tokens for a
        | particular period, usually one or two years. For instance, if a startup
        | creates a cryptocurrency project and launches it through an ICO or
        | crowdfunding event, they may set up a lockup period.
